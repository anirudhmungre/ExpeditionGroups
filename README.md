# ExpeditionGroups
A group of people is planning an expedition. For safety, they decide to split into two groups; it does not matter how many people are in each group. Not all of them are good friends, and one reason for splitting is to separate all pairs that are not friendly to each other. Your goal is to design and implement an algorithm that, given the map of friendship relations between people in the group, would find a partition of people into two groups of friends, or say that it is impossible. Assume that the input is an n Ã— n matrix M, where n is the number of people in the group and M(i, j) = 1 if i and j are friends, and 0 otherwise. Also, if i is friendly to j, then j is friendly to i. Your output should be the sequence of numbers corresponding to people assigned to the first group
